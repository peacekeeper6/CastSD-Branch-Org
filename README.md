# Project ELIMIN8
## https://projectelimin8.tk/ 
### Project ELIMIN8 was started with one goal in mind: to reduce waste and starvation. We are an ever-growing non-profit branch organization under CastSD that strives to make a change in our communities. We are mainly located in San Diego, California but have expanded to other areas across America and are looking to expand throughout the world as well. Members of Project ELIMIN8 pick up surplus food and donate it to organizations weekly. 

We set up relations between organizations that give us surplus food and donate to organizations that are in need of it. That way, we are able to help both causes with maximal effectiveness. 

To become a member, you can register through our Register Page. After creating an account, we will be in contact with you as soon as possible in order to set up a connection within your area. For donations, please refer to the Donation Page. For your unanswered questions, lingering curiosity, and anything in general, please refer to our Contact Page.

These are the values that we hold dear to our organization.
