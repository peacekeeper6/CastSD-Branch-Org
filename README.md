# Project ELIMIN8
## This branch was initially created in order to remedy an issue in VS Code that failed to identify myself as owner of this repository. This issue also resulted in me being able to commit to this branch with the same account while being unable to commmit to main.

This issue is now fixed, but I continue to work on this branch and use it as the sole branch with a Flask virtual environment set up. The virtual environment causes conflictions with deployment as I am using git pull from main, so moving all files out of the venv allows for one to avoid these conflictions. I mostly commit to this branch for final touches then create pull requests to push to main, which will then trigger changes in the deployment once it is updated.
