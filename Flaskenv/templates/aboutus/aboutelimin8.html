          <h1>What is Project ELIMIN8?</h1>
          <p>Project ELIMIN8 was started with one goal in mind: to reduce waste and starvation. We are an ever-growing non-profit branch organization under CastSD that hopes to become independent soon. We are mainly located in San Diego, California but have expanded to other areas across America and are looking to expand throughout the world as well.</p>

          <h1>What does Project ELIMIN8 do?</h1>
          <p>Members of Project ELIMIN8 pick up surplus food and donate it to organizations weekly. We set up relations between organizations that give us surplus food and donate to organizations that are in need of it. That way, we are able to help both causes with maximal effectiveness.</p>
